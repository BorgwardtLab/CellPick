Installation
============

We recommend installing CellPick in an isolated environment using `pipx`:

.. code-block:: bash

   pipx install cellpick

.. note::
   You can install pipx using `pip install pipx`. Running `pipx ensurepath` will add pipx (and cellpick) to your PATH.

This will install the `cellpick` command globally, isolated from your other Python packages.
