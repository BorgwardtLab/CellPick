**CellPick** is an interactive tool designed to streamline the selection of cells for laser microdissection in single-cell spatial omics applications.  
It features a custom shape selection technique that leverages combinatorial optimization to select non-contiguous cells, maximizing coverage within a defined tissue region.  
CellPick also enables users to establish spatial gradients between landmarks, automatically scoring cells by their proximity to points of interestâ€”facilitating downstream analyses such as correlating protein intensities with spatial location.
